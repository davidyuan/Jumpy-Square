Hi,

Jumpy Square is a pretty minimal game about dodging blocks all while you have to fight against gravity to not fall of the bottom.

It's kind of hard to explain so here is a glimpse of the gameplay:

Although this might seem to be just another endless runner, I can assure you it feels quite different.
